# Obsidian Weaver

I am a user of Obsidian.  It helps me structure, observe and react to the chaos of life.  Last week (october 2025), I decided to start from scratch and redo my Obsidian setup.  This repo will be an living artifact of this new reconstruction.  

# Why weaver?
Weaver birds are famous for their intricate, woven nests. They use grass, leaves, and twigs to create elaborate hanging structures that look like works of art.  Different species of weaver birds design nests in unique styles. Some make bottle-shaped nests, while others create ball-like or tunnel-shaped ones.
